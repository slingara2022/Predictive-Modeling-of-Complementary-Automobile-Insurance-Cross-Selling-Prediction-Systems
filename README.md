# Predictive-Modeling-of-Complementary-Automobile-Insurance-Cross-Selling-Prediction-Systems
In this project, The client is an Insurance company XYZ Ltd., that has covered Health Insurance to its customers. Now, They need to construct a prediction model to predict whether or not the policy holders from a year can also be inquisitive about Vehicle Insurance furnished with the aid of using the business enterprise. Developing a model to estimate whether or not a consumer might be inquisitive about automobile coverage is extraordinarily beneficial for the business enterprise. This could permit the corporation to plan its marketing and communication processes to approach in order that it is able to attain out to those clients and optimize its enterprise vertical.

## Questions of Interest :rocket:
In a few bullet points, list 3-5 questions you would like to answer in the context you have described using your data. Think of questions you can answer with descriptive information. Are there outcomes you would like to predict from your data? Causal questions? Here is a hypothetical example about home foreclosures in our county.
- What is the percentage of male / female policyholders from past year who will also be interested in Vehicle Insurance provided by the company?
- What age group are most of the customers who are interested in buying this company's insurance?
- In which region do most of the customers who are interested in buying Vehicle Insurance come from?
- Are customers who got his/her vehicle damaged in the past more likely to be interested in vehicle insurance?
- Are customers who have been associated with the company more days more  likely to be interested in vehicle insurance?

## Data Processing and Analysis :rocket:
### Dataset Description
The dataset consists of customer data of a health insurance company. The data describes customer details such as gender, age, driving license, region code, insurance history, annual premium, vehicle information, and interest in vehicle insurance. There are 127,000 instances and 12 variables we can explore. We will download the dataset from Kaggle.com. 
Data Processing Tasks
Data processing tasks that we will be performing in our project are - 
- Acquiring the dataset: For this project we use the Kaggle dataset of Health Insurance Cross Sell.
- Handling Outliers: Removing or replacing the outliers from the project.
- Feature engineering: Transform data into more meaningful representation by adding in domain knowledge. For example turning age data into categories.
- Transforming categorical data:  To do analysis on the categorical data we convert categorical data into numerical values by using encoding and dummy variables.
- Feature Scaling: Limiting the range of variables so that you can compare them on common grounds.
- Dealing with imbalance: Adding/generating more data for the minority class to avoid  over-training on the majority class.

## Data Analysis :rocket:
What kinds of visualizations and modeling do you need to do to answer your questions of interest? Maps? Charts? Will your visuals be static or interactive? Provide specific detail on how your visualizations and modeling will answer each question. In other words, justify your selections.
- Using a Barplot visualization to compare how many customers are interested to get vehicle insurance and how many are not interested.
- Using a Barplot visualization to compare the gender distribution in the insurance from this comparison we can get to know how many customers are male and how many customers are female.
- Using a Barplot visualization to analyze how many customers have a driving license and how many customers donâ€™t have a driving license based on the response which the customers have provided and to get to know how many customers are eligible to buy vehicle insurance
- Using Pie Chart visualization to analyze how many customers are previously insured and how many customers don't have insurance from this analysis we can get to know the potential clients who are planning to get insurance.
- Using Barplot visualization to analyze whether the customer vehicle has any history of damage in the past or no damage.
- Using Barplot visualization by grouping the age of the customer's vehicle to age to understand the average age of the car for which the insurance demand is more.
- Using Boxplot visualization to understand the wide range of customers who are associated with the company.
- Using histogram visualization to understand which part of the region the customers are more interested to buy the vehicle insurance.
- Using histogram visualization to understand the age of the customers to get to know how many young, mid-aged, and old aged customers are there and comparing that with their respective age of the vehicle so we can understand what kind of car the customers own based on the age group. I.e, the young people with a newer vehicle or the mid-aged people have the old vehicle.
- Using Relplot visualization to understand which age group customers have the history of more vehicle damage.
- Using Distplot visualization to understand the distribution of age of customers  which are there in the insurance group.
